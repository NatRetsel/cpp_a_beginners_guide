# Module 5 Mastery Check

1. Show the general form of a function
   ```
   return_type function_name (parameter_list) {
        // function body
   }
   
   ```
2. Create a function called hypot() that computes the length of the hypothenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the two opposing sides. Demonstrate its use in a program. For this problem, you will need to use the sqrt() standard library function, which returns the square root of its argument.

3. Can a function return a pointer? Can a function return an array?
   - Yes, No.
  
4. Create your own version of the standard library function strlen(). Call your version mystrlen(), and demonstrate its use in a program.
   - Visit solution folder.
  
5. Does a local variable maintain its value between calls to the function in which it is declared?
   - No, unless it is statically typed.
  
6. Give one benefit of global variables. Give one disadvantage.
   - Advantage: variable can be accessed throughout every scope in the program. Disadvantage: tedious to debug.
  
7. Create a function called byThrees() that returns a series of numbers, with each value 3 greater than the preceding one. Have the series start at 0. Thus, the first five numbers returned by byThrees() are 0,3,6,9, and 12. Create another function called reset() that causes byThrees() to start the series over again from 0. Demonstrate your functions in a program. Hint: you will need to use a global variable.

8. Write a program that requires a password that is specified on the command line. Your program doesn't have to actually do anything except report whether the password was entered correctly or incorrectly.
   - Visit solution folder.
  
9. A prototype prevents a function from being called with an improper number of arguments. True or false?
    - True
  
10. Write a recursive function that prints the numbers 1 through 10. Demonstrate its use in a program.
    - Visit solution folder.
