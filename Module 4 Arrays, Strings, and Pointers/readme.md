# Module 4 Mastery Check

1. Show how to declare a short int array called hightemps that is 31 elements long.
   - `short hightemps[31];`
  
2. In C++, all arrays begin indexing at ___.
   - Index 0
  
3. Write a program that searches an array of ten integers for duplicate values. Have the program display each duplicate found.
   - Visit solution folder.
  
4. What is a null-terminated string?
   - A character array where the last element is the null character \0.
  
5. Write a program that prompts the user for two strings and then compares the strings for equality, but ignores case differences. Thus, "ok" and "OK" will compare as equal.
   - Visit solution folder.
  
6. When using strcat(), how large must the recipient array be?
   - At least the size of both strings combined plus a null character.
  
7. In a multidimensional array, how is each index specified?
   - array[row][column]
  
8. Show how to initialize an int array called nums with the values 5, 66, and 88.
   - `int nums[] = {5, 66,88};`
  
9. What is the principal advantage of an unsized array declaration?
   - The user does not have to worry about managing size of array. It ensures the array is always large enough to holder the initializers being specified.
  
10. What is a pointer? What are the two pointer operators?
    - A pointer is a variable containing the address of a memory. The two pointer operators are deferencing (*) and referencing (&).
   
11. Can a pointer be indexed like an array? Can an array be accessed through a pointer?
    - Yes and yes.
   
12. Write a program the counts the uppercase letters in a string. Have it display the result.
    - Visit the solutions folder.
   
13. What is it called when one pointer points to another pointer?
    - Multiple indirection
   
14. Of what significance is a null pointer in C++?
    - Pointer safety for unused pointers by convention.
