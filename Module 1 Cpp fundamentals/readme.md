3. What are the three main principles of OOP?
   - Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.
     
4. Where do C++ programs begin execution?
   - Programs begin execution at main().
     
5. What is a header?
   - A header contains function declarations or even global variables to be used by the program.
     
6. What is <iostream>? What does `#include <iostream>` do?
   - <iostream> is the header supporting I/O. The include statement includes the header into a program.
     
7. What is a namespace?

    - General form of if statement: `if (condition) statement;`. The general form of a for loop: `for(initialization; condition; increment) statement;`.
      
12. How do you create a block of code?
    - A block of code is enclosed within { and }.
      
13. The moon's gravity is about 17 percent that of Earth's. Write a program that displays a table that shows Earth pounds and their equivalent moon weight. Have the table run from 1 to 100 pounbds. Output a newline every 25 pounds.
